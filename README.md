üß† Self-Directed Online Machine Learning for Topology Optimization (Practice Project)

This is a practice project aimed at understanding and experimenting with the Self-Directed Online Learning (SOLO) algorithm [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27713-7] in the context of topology optimization.

I first encountered this concept during the ‚ÄúAI for Design and Optimization‚Äù course on Coursera, which sparked my interest in applying machine learning to structural design problems.

Using ChatGPT for guidance, I implemented a simplified example to explore the steps of the algorithm and gain a deeper understanding of its workflow. Although the project is still in progress and not fully concluded, it serves as a foundation for further development and experimentation.
